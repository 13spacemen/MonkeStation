changes:
  - bugfix: Explosive lances will properly show the grenade on them at construction.
  - balance: Hitting someone in melee with the explosive lance now moves you to the
      same tile as them before it sets off the grenade.
  - bugfix: can no longer use explosive lances to store grenade phylacteries inside
      of indestructible objects (including structures)), immortal mobs, or effects.
