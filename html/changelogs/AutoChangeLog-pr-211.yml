  - rscadd: BoxStation and MetaStation no longer only have a Super Matter crystal.
      You may find yourself having to setup a Singularity engine, or even a Tesla
      to generate power. All three engine types can spawn at roundstart, but only
      one WILL spawn.
  - rscadd: Magboots to Engineer EVA Lockers for both MetaStation and BoxStation
