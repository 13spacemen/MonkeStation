  - rscadd: 'All drug addictions are now put into 5 categories: Stimulants, Opiods,
      Alcohol, hallucinogens, and maintenance drugs. There is no longer an addiction
      threshold and becoming addicted is done by gaining addiction points from doing
      drugs in a specific category, if you become addicted you can stop being addicted
      by lowering your addiction points until it reaches a low enough value.'
